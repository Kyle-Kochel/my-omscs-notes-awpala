# Comparison-Based Sorting

## 1. Introduction

This lesson is about parallel algorithms for ***sorting*** in the dynamic multi-threading model, and is comprised of two parts.

The first part of this lesson consists of videos, which cover the idea of a **sorting network**.

A sorting network is a special kind of circuit which performs sorting (as in the figure shown above).
  * ***N.B.*** This topic is not typically covered in a standard undergraduate algorithms course. It is therefore introduced here both for the edification and enjoyment of students in this course.

Separately from the videos component, this lesson also entails a short chapter on **parallel merge sort** from algorithm textbook CLRS (as in the figure shown above), intended to reinforce the main ideas behind the dynamic multi-threading model.

This lesson will also introduce some additional techniques to analyze algorithms in this model more formally.
