# Dynamic Programming: Topic Introduction

**Dynamic programming** (**DP**) is an extremely useful technique.
  * ***N.B.*** Students often have trouble with this topic, however, with sufficient practice, it will become more intuitive and familiar. The lectures will also demonstrate illustrative examples for this purpose.

The ***key*** to mastering dynamic programming is to perform lots of practice problems. While the homeworks are a starting point, do additional textbook problems and other references (e.g., textbooks, courses, etc.) for further practice.

The ***outline*** for this section is as follows:
  * **Fibonacci numbers** â†’ This is a "toy example" to illustrate the basic idea of dynamic programming
  * Subsequently to computing Fibonacci numbers, we will dive into a variety of example problems to get a feel for the different styles of dynamic programming algorithms, including:
    * **Longest Increasing Subsequence** (**LIS**)
    * **Longest Common Subsequence** (**LCS**)
    * **Knapsack**
    * **Chain Matrix Multiplication**
    * **Shortest Path Algorithms**
