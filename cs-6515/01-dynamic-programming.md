**Dynamic programming** (**DP**) is an extremely useful technique.
  * ***N.B.*** Students often have trouble with this topic, however, with sufficient practice, it will become more intuitive and familiar. The lectures will also demonstrate illustrative examples for this purpose.

The ***key*** to mastering dynamic programming is to perform lots of practice problems. While the homeworks are a starting point, do additional textbook problems and other references (e.g., textbooks, courses, etc.) for further practice.

The ***outline*** for this section is as follows:
  * **Fibonacci numbers** â†’ This is a "toy example" to illustrate the basic idea of dynamic programming
  * Subsequently to computing Fibonacci numbers, we will dive into a variety of example problems to get a feel for the different styles of dynamic programming algorithms, including:
    * **Longest Increasing Subsequence** (**LIS**)
    * **Longest Common Subsequence** (**LCS**)
    * **Knapsack**
    * **Chain Matrix Multiplication**
    * **Shortest Path Algorithms**

Given an integer $n$, we wil look at an algorithm for generating the corresponding $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. This is a very simple algorithm, but it will illustrate the idea of dynamic programming; later we will examine dynamic programming more generally (i.e., techniques for designing a dynamic programming algorithm, as well as more sophisticated examples).

Recall that the Fibonacci numbers are the following sequence:

$$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \dots$$

There is a simple recursive formula that defines the Fibonacci numbers as follows:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{array}{l}
{F_{0} = 0,\ F_{1} = 1}\\
{\rm{for}\ n > 1:}\\
\ \ \ \ {F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}}
\end{array}
}
$$

Furthermore:
  * ***Input***: integer $n \ge 0$
  * ***Output***: $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number

We want an ***efficient*** algorithm to achieve this goal/output. Therefore, we are aiming for a ***running time*** which is ***polynomial*** in $n$ .

Since the Fibonacci numbers are defined by this simple recursive formula, we might therefore think that a recursive algorithm is a natural algorithm for this particular problem. We will look at this recursive algorithm next, as well as analyze it accordingly.

### 3. Recursive Algorithm

#### Algorithm

Let us now examine the natural recursive algorithm for computing the $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.

Recall (cf. Section 2) that the recursive formula for the $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, i.e.,:

$$
{\rm{for\ }}n > 1:\ F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
$$

The recursive algorithm ($\rm{Fib1}(n)$ ) can be specified in more detail as follows:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{array}{l}
{{\rm{Fib1}}(n):}\\
\ \ \ \ {{\rm{input:\ integer\ }} n \ge 0}\\
\ \ \ \ {{\rm{output:\ }}{F_{n}}}\\
\ \ \ \ {{\rm{if\ }}n = 0,\ {\rm{return\ }} (0)}\\
\ \ \ \ {{\rm{if\ }}n = 1,\ {\rm{return\ }} (1)}\\
\ \ \ \ {{\rm{return\ }} ({\rm{Fib1}}(n-1) + {\rm{Fib1}}(n-2))}
\end{array}
}
$$

In the ***base cases***, the Fibonacci numbers $0$ and $1$ are simply returned.

In the more general ***recursive cases***, the previous two Fibonacci numbers are computed and returned recursively as a sum.

This completes the definition of the recursive algorithm.

#### Analysis

Let us now consider the ***running time*** of this recursive algorithm.

</center>

To analyze this algorithm, let us create a function $T(n)$ which denotes the number of steps in the algorithm (i.e., $\rm{Fib1}(n)$ ), given an input size of $n$ .

The two base cases each require $O(1)$ time.

The two recursive calls require time $T(n-1) + T(n-2)$ .

Combining these two gives the following general formula:

$$
T(n) \le O(1) + T(n-1) + T(n-2)
$$

This formula may be familiar: It resembles the Fibonacci numbers themselves!
  * ***N.B.*** cf. $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ from previously in this section. Furthermore, the constant term $O(1)$ is dominated by the other two terms as $n$ increases.

Therefore, in general:

$$
T(n) \ge F_{n}
$$

Unfortunately, the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially in $n$ , i.e.,:

$$
T(n) \ge F_{n} \approx {\phi^{n}  \over {\sqrt 5 }}
$$

where the constant $\phi$ is called the **golden ratio**, defined as:

$$
\phi = {{1 + \sqrt{5}} \over {2}} \approx 1.618
$$

Therefore, since the runtime grows ***exponentially*** in $n$ for this recursive algorithm $\rm{Fib1}(n)$ , it is a *terrible* algorithm with respect to performance. Let us examine *why* the running time is so terrible next (which in turn will inform the design of a more efficient algorithm to rectify this).

### 4. Exponential Running Time

Let us now consider the ***recursive*** nature of this recursive algorithm.

At the top level of the recursion, the $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number is computed. From there, recursive sub-calls are made to compute the $n-1$ and $n-2$ Fibonacci numbers. The recursive calls similarly proceed in this manner.

Observe that several of the sub-calls are computed *multiple* times (e.g., $n-4$ ). In fact, these "redundant sub-computations" increase exponentially with $n$ ; indeed, this is the root cause of the inefficiency in this recursive algorithm (i.e., repeated computation of the smaller sub-problems).

</center>

To resolve this inefficiency (i.e., redundant computations), the algorithm will be "flipped on its head": We will compute the *smallest* sub-problems *first*, and then proceed in this manner up to the larger sub-problems (until reaching $n$ ).

To accomplish this, an ***array*** $F$ is defined, where $F_i$ denotes the $i$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. Correspondingly, starting at index $i = 0$ , the first Fibonacci number is recorded as $0$ . Proceeding in this manner yields the following:

| $i$ | $F_i$ |
|:--:|:--:|
| $0$ | $0$ |
| $1$ | $1$ |
| $2$ | $1$ |
| $3$ | $2$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $n$ | $F_n$ |

where in general $F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}$ (i.e., until reaching $F_i = F_n$ accordingly).

This constitutes the corresponding ***dynamic programming algorithm*** in question, which will be defined more precisely next.
