# Fault Tolerance

## 1. Lesson Introduction

This lesson will examine **reliability** and **availability**, how device faults can result in failures, and how to ensure adequate performance of computer devices even in the event of failure.

## 2. Dependability

The first concept pertaining to fault tolerance is that of **dependability**, which is a characteristic of the delivered service itself. It is the quality of the delivered service that justifies relying on the system in order to provide that service. A **dependable system** is one which provides the service in a way which is "correct"/"as expected."

The "service" itself is comprised of the following two ***definitions***:
  * The **specified service** is the *expected* behavior of the service
  * The **delivered service** is the *actual*/*observed* behavior of the service

Given these definitions, dependability can therefore be understood as the "matching" between the specified service and the delivered service.

Furthermore, note that the system itself has **components** (called **modules**), with each component/module having a corresponding "ideally" specified behavior, from which a "real" component/module will typically deviate to some degree (i.e., this is descriptive of the level of dependability/undependability in this context).
  * ***N.B.*** In this context, "components" are referring to larger, system-scale components (i.e., at the scale of the computer system itself such as the processor, memory, etc., *not* "sub-components" such as transistors)
