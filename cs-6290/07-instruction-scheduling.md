# Instruction Scheduling

## 1. Lesson Introduction

In this lesson, we will see how **instruction scheduling** allows us to execute programs faster, even when these programs have data dependencies; and how to execute more than one instruction every cycle.

## 2. Improving IPC

This lesson will examine how to improve the instructions per cycle (IPC) using out-of-order execution, as well as how to design *actual* hardware to accomplish this.

With respect to improving the IPC, we have seen (cf. Lesson 6) that **instruction level parallelism (ILP)** can be good (i.e., `>> 1`, typically larger than `4` or so).

However, in order to achieve performance approaching ILP, it is necessary to handle the **control dependencies**. To this end, we have seen (cf. Lesson 6) how branch prediction can help to eliminate control dependencies if **branch prediction** is correct.
  * If the branch prediction is *very good* (which on modern machines, it typically *is*), then insofar as control dependencies are concerned, the IPC will approach ILP.

Additionally, it is necessary to consider the data dependencies **write-after-read (WAR)** and **write-after-write (WAW)**, also called **false dependencies**. **Register renaming** provides a resolution measure to completely eliminate these false dependencies, such that they cease to exist in the program anymore, thereby removing their deleterious effect on IPC.

Furthermore, **read-after-write (RAW)** dependencies (also called **true dependencies**) must also be resolved. For this, recall (cf. Lesson 6) that **out-of-order execution** (i.e., not strictly following the sequential program instructions, but rather immediately executing instructions whose inputs are executable in any given cycle) provides a resolution measure for eliminating RAW dependencies, thereby improving IPC.

Finally, **structural dependencies** arise when instructions cannot be executed due to lack of available resources in the processor in a given cycle. To provide a resolution measure for eliminating structural dependencies, use a **wider-issue** processor (i.e., one which can handle many instructions in each cycle, thereby minimizing the need to delay instructions due to lack of available resources).

Among these resolution measures, it remains to be determined how these can be performed. Initially, this lesson will focus on register renaming and out-of-order execution, in particular, implementing these resolution measures in a manner which is amenable to actual hardware implementation in a processor (i.e., beyond simply "on paper").
