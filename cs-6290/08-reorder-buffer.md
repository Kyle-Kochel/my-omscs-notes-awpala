# ReOrder Buffer (ROB)

## 1. Lesson Introduction

We have seen (cf. Lesson 7) that processor performance can be improved substantially by reordering instructions. However, this is not always straightforward to accomplish in practice.

In real programs, **exceptions** can occur (e.g., divide by zero), which can disrupt program operation if the instructions are not executed exactly in program-order.

This lesson explains how to resolve these reordering issues when such exceptions do occur.
