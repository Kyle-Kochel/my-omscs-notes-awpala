# Memory

## 1. Lesson Introduction

This lesson will discuss how different types of memory work, as well as why we cannot have memory that is simultaneously large, fast, *and* cheap.

This lesson will also describe how memory chips can pack so many bits in such a relatively small physical space.

## 2. How Memory Works

This lesson will examine how memory works, and with particular focus on the following topics:
  * Memory technology - SRAM and DRAM (i.e., what do these mean, and how do they work)
  * Why is main memory so slow?
  * Why not simply use cache-like memory in place of main memory in order to improve its speed?
  * What occurs on cache miss and consequent main-memory access?
  * How can main memory be made to be faster (i.e., reducing the latency resulting from a cache miss)?
