# Introduction

## 1. Lesson Introduction

This course will cover how modern processor cores work, how these cores access memory, and how they are assembled into a multi-core chip.

However, to start off: What *is* computer architecture?

## 2. What Is Computer Architecture?

In the traditional sense, "*architecture*" pertains to the design of a building that is well-suited for its purpose (e.g., apartment vs. house vs. office building).

Similarly, **computer architecture** pertains to the design of a ***computer*** that is will-suited for its purpose (e.g., desktop vs. laptop vs. mobile device).

## 3. Why Do We Need Computer Architecture?

Computer architecture provides several uses:
  1. To improve **performance** -- making computers faster, smaller, cheaper
      * Speed of computation
      * Battery life
      * Overall size and weight of the computer
      * Energy efficiency
      * etc.
  2. To improve **abilities** -- enhancing computers' capabilities
      * 3D graphics support
      * Debugging support
      * Improving security

Accomplishing these goals requires improvements in fabrication technology and in circuit designs, and then translating these into devices which are faster, lighter, cheaper, more secure, etc. via computer architecture.

## 4. Computer Architecture Quiz and Answers

Computer architecture is about: (Select all that apply.)
  * How to build faster transistors
    * `DOES NOT APPLY` - Computer architecture may involve the use of such faster transistors for building better/faster computers, but it does not pertain to the design of these transistors themselves.
  * How to build faster computers
    * `APPLIES` - Since a "faster" computer may fit the criterion of a "better" computer, computer architecture is a key method by which such a faster/better computer can be achieved.
  * How to build larger buildings
    * `DOES NOT APPLY`
  * How to design energy-efficient computers
    * `APPLIES` - Energy efficiency is another criterion by which a computer can be deemed "better."
  * How to build buildings that fit more computers
    * `DOES NOT APPLY`
  * How to build computers that fit better into buildings
    * `APPLIES` - Optimizing the size of a computer is another criterion related to computer architecture.
