# Cache Review

## 1. Lesson Introduction

In this lesson, we will review **caches**.
  * ***N.B.*** This material should be known already (i.e., course prerequisite), however, it is extremely important to understand the basics of caches before proceeding onto virtual memory (cf. Lesson 13) and other more advanced caching topics (cf. Lesson 14). Therefore, this lesson will correspondingly include *more* detail than is included in a typical "review" lesson.

Understanding caches requires an understanding of **locality**. 

The **locality principle** states that things that will happen ***soon*** are likely to be close to things that ***just*** happened.
  * This means that if we know something about the past behavior, then we are likely to be able to guess what will occur soon.

We have already seen the locality principle previously in branch prediction (cf. Lesson 4). Now, we will see this in the context of **caches**.
