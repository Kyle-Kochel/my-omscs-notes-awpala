# Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)

## 1. Lesson Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about **very long instruction word (VLIW)** and explicitly parallel processors (e.g., Intel's Itanium). Unlike their out-of-order counterparts, these processors do ***not*** attempt to identify instruction-level parallelism (ILP) on their own, but rather defer to the compiler instead.

## 2. Superscalar vs. VLIW
