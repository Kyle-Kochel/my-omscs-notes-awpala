# P1L1: Introduction to Compilers

## 1. Introduction to Course

This course will study **compilers**, which translate from a program written in a high-level source language into a lower-level assembly language.
  * ***N.B.*** This course will ***not*** study a particular high-level-language-to-machine-code translation, but rather the course will focus on the theories and algorithms which can be applied to any language and/or machine.

The course is divided into three sections (corresponding to the constituent ***phases*** of the compilation process), as follows:
  * **front-end** → syntactic and semantic analysis of the source language
  * **middle-end** → the intermediate representation, and the corresponding analysis and optimizations associated with the source-code translation
  * **back-end** (or **code generator**) → generator of the resulting machine code

## 2. Introduction to Compilers

This lesson will examine the overall working of the compiler in terms of its various aforementioned phases (cf. Section 1), and their corresponding interactions. In particular, this section will highlight the following ***concepts***:
  * **tokenization**
  * **parsing**
  * **symbol tables**
  * **semantic analysis**

These concepts will be demonstrated in the context of a simple language and its corresponding processing, based on the language's grammar and its lexical specification.
